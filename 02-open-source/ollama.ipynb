       "\" The given SQL queries are designed to create a deduplication system that removes duplicate entries in a dataset based on certain key columns. Here's a descriptive summary of what the entire process achieves:\\n\\n1. **Create Deduplication Tables**: First, two tables (deduplication_keys and destination_table) are created to store deduplicated keys (`hash`) and data respectively. The `destination_table` will eventually hold cleaned dataset with no duplicates.\\n\\n2. **Iterate Over Partition Sets**: This system operates on a partitioned table (partitioning by year, month, day, hour). For each combination of these partitions, deduplication is performed and results are inserted into the destination_table using an `OVERWRITE` clause to replace existing data with de-duplicated values.\\n\\n3. Administer Partition Set Iteration: Each partition set's rows go through a selection process where they generate hashes by concatenating their non-null columns (account number, external ID, amount, title), and then check for the presence of these hashes in the deduplication_keys table to identify duplicates.\\n\\n4. Insert Deduplicated Hash Values: All unique hash values from each partition set are inserted into the dedicated deduplication_keys table, which acts as an index or a lookup table for checking duplicates during data insertion.\\n\\n5. Data Inclusion and Insertion into Destination Table: The clean, de-duplicated dataset is then selected once more, ensuring only distinct entries based on their hash value are chosen to prevent inserting duplicate rows in the final destination_table.\\n\\n6. Deduplication System Workflows: \\n   - Initially, it deduplicates and stores unique values using `INSERT OVERWRITE` clause into partitioned dataset (destination_table).\\n   - Subsequently, hashes for each distinct row are stored in the deduplication_keys table to act as a reference.\\n   - Finally, all records with de-duplicated data and non-duplicate hash values are inserted back into the destination_table using `INSERT INTO` clause after removing duplicates.\\n\\nIn summary, these SQL queries aim to create an effective system for deduplication by separating distinct rows from a source table based on specific columns (account number, external ID, amount, and title), storing unique hashes in dedicated tables (`deduplication_keys`), and ensuring no duplicates are present within the final resultant dataset stored in `destination_table`.\""

       "\" In 1945, Warsaw, Poland experienced a series of significant and tragic events. One of the most notable is the Warsaw Uprising (Akcja Wyzwolenia warszawskiego), which occurred from August 1 to October 2, 1944. This was a large act of resistance by the Polish Home Army against the occupying German forces during World War II. The aim was to liberate Warsaw before the arrival of the Soviet Red Army; however, it ended in failure as the uprising was crushed and much of the city was destroyed.\\n\\nAfter several months following this initial uprising, on January 17, 1945, Soviet forces entered Warsaw after fierce fighting with German units. Although the Soviets were allies of the Polish government in exile, their entrance into the city led to further tensions between them and the newly established pro-Soviet provisional government installed by the Red Army.\\n\\nLater that year on August 1, 1945, a new uprising known as the Ghetto Uprising (Gwarecki Powstanie) took place within Warsaw's Jewish ghettos against Nazi forces during their final liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. This was an earlier and separate event from the larger citywide resistance in 1944, but it remains a symbol of courage and defiance against oppression.\\n\\nIn summary, by 1945, Warsaw had been deeply scarred by warfare, with key events including both the failed uprising to expel German forces from within its city limits in 1944 and significant battles during its liberation in early 1945. The post-war period would also be marked by further conflict between different Polish factions under Soviet influence.\""
