Each C value represents a hyperparameter that affects how the model learns from the training data—smaller values introduce more regularization, potentially resulting in a simpler model that may underfit, while larger values reduce regularization, allowing for a more complex model that may overfit.\\n\\nBy looping through these C values, cross-validation allows for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance for each configuration, identifying the best C value that balances model complexity and generalization.

I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop.
